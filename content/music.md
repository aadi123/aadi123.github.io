Hello, and welcome to the main landing page for my music! Although my background is primarily
in South Indian Carnātic Classical music, I am also trying to experiment with other genres, such as: devotional,
light, and Indian film music. 

To me, Carnātic music is one of the best forms of music in the world. The myriad of rāgās,
and its compositions are complex as they are beautiful. I have come to appreciate the tradition, and I hope
to share that with some of you. Here is some of the music I have recorded (best enjoyed with headphones).
