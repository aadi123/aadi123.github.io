Hello, and welcome to my website! The title of this website, abhyƒÅsa, means *constant practice* in the Sanskrit language, and refers
to the hope that this website allows me to constantly practice my writing and critical thinking skills as I reflect on various topics related
but not limited to: technology, finance, current events, music, and much more!

Please use the navigation bar at the top of this page to learn more about me and to view some of my old blog posts.
