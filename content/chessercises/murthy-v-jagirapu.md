This game was played in the Southwest Open 2023 that took place in Houston, TX. This was one of
the first games I played after freshly coming out of chess retirement. I had the following position:

![White to play](/images/murthy-v-jagirapu.jpg)

In the above position, Black just played the move *h6*. Can you punish Black's last move
and take advantage of the uncastled king's position in the center?

Answer: {{< inlinespoiler >}}Nxe6!! is the correct move! Ripping apart the protection of the black king and allowing all of white's pieces to spring into the game.{{< /inlinespoiler >}}
