This is my first blog post!! I will attempt to introduce myself and
my motivations for starting a blog, and also attempt to convince you
why PPI should be a big factor when evaluating the quality of a display.

## Introduction
Hello dear readers, and welcome to my blog! If you've managed to make it this far,
Congratulations! The state of the blog and is still in-progress and will evolve over time, and I appreciate
you taking the time to read it in spite of its limitations.

### About Me
Hi! I'm Aaditya Murthy. Currently, I am working on the Video Ingestion team at Toyota Connected as a Software Engineer. Previoiusly I worked at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer for the past two years. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from UT Austin in 2020.
I like to sing, play chess, and run for fun, and I dabble in some other things as well (Music Production, video-games, game-streaming, and much more).
Anyways, I wanted to start a blog mostly to blog about interesting topics within Computer Science and Mathematics,
but I hope to also blog about other things (life, music, etc.) as well! Let's see where this goes, and I sincerely hope that you as the reader will find some value in it!

## What is PPI?
With that out of the way, I'd like to introduce the topic I have chosen for this post, PPI. **PPI** or *pixels per inch* refers to the number of pixels in an inch on the display. The two factors that influence PPI are screen size and resolution. The larger the screen size for the same resolution, the lower the PPI. The higher the resolution for the same screen size, the higher the PPI.

## Why is it Important
I would like to first introduce this post on the topic [What is HiDPI](https://cassidyjames.com/blog/what-is-hidpi/). This post
does a great job of explaining why
