This is my year in review blog post. I know this is coming in hilariously late,
and I've missed all the different New Year holidays (Gregorian, Makara Sankranti, and Lunar New Year), but
this post is better late than never.

## About Work
As many of you may know, I had a pretty rough start to 2023. My org was affected by the
round of [mass layoffs at Amazon](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs), leaving me stranded in the heart of
Seattle. Thankfully, I was able pay an early termination fee to cancel my apartment lease, and move back in Dallas.

The first few months of 2023 had me frantically job-searching. Thankfully I was able to find another job, and I am really grateful for that.
I am grateful that I can still be working in the industry even in such a tough economic environment with constant fear of job cuts
and hiring-freezes.

## Moving Back to Dallas
Although I was initially hesitant to move back to Dallas, I see the value in it now. I don't
have to pay rent yet, so I can save up a little more especially during tough economic times such as this.

### Relationship With Family
One great thing about living back in Dallas means that my relationship with my parents has greatly improved.

### Involvement in Dallas Kannada and Indian Fine Arts Associations
Another big part of being in Dallas is the Indian Fine Arts and Mallige Kannada Associations that exist in Dallas.

## About Chess

## About Carnatic Music

## Life Lessons Learned
### Letting Go
### Practicing Gratitude
### Avoiding Unnecesary Comparisons

## Looking forward to 2024
