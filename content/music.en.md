Hello, and welcome to the main landing page for my music! Although my background is primarily
in South Indian Carnātic Classical music, I am also trying to experiment with other genres, such as: devotional,
light, Indian film music, and western music.

<!---Here is some of the music I have recorded (best enjoyed with headphones).
